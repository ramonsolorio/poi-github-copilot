This C program is a simple implementation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation on a text file named "crud.txt". The program uses file handling and string operations to perform these tasks. Here's a breakdown of the functions:

dicaprio(): This function is used to create and append data to the file. It opens the file in append mode, takes user input, and writes it to the file.

denzel(): This function is used to read data from the file. It opens the file in read mode and prints the contents to the console.

hanks(): This function is used to update data in the file. It opens the original file and a temporary file, takes the old and new data from the user, and writes the updated data to the temporary file. If the old data is found in the original file, it's replaced with the new data. The original file is then deleted and the temporary file is renamed to the original file's name.

freeman(): This function is used to delete data from the file. It works similarly to the update function, but instead of replacing the old data, it simply omits it when writing to the temporary file.

main(): This function presents a menu to the user to choose an operation. It uses a switch case to call the appropriate function based on the user's choice. The menu is presented in an infinite loop, which can be exited by choosing the "Exit" option.

Note: The function names and variable names are non-descriptive and seem to be named after famous personalities. It would be better to use descriptive names for clarity and maintainability.
